•	Missing of Electronic Components (RAS)
By a survey of components purchased during Robothon 4.0, it is found that about half of the components are missing from the library.

•	Missing of Hospitality Items
After ISQIP'18 it is found that many hospitality items like Glasses, etc. were missing from the library, thus showing the irresponsibility of volunteers.

•	Purchase of Hospitality Items
Irine (WIE Sec.) suggested about the purchase of some needful things for the hospitality for the upcoming events. Some of them are:
	o	Electric Kettle / Flask
	o	Towels
	o	Spoons
	o	Glass Set
	o	Room Freshener
	o	Bathroom Freshener
	o	Reusable Waste Plates
	o	Washbasin Brush
Purchase these items before AKPESSC, by the profit of ISQIP'18. Please make a deal with the respective chairs for taking money from their societies.

•	Locks for three Shelves
Separate locks and keys for 3 Shelves: Hospitality, Components, Documents and the keys should be in the hands of:
	o	Hospitality		- Irine (WIE Sec.)
	o	Components		- Hari (RAS Sec.)
	o	Documents		- Georgy (SB Sec.) and Jithin (SB Treasurer)  
A thorough checking should be done after each event.
      
•	Account Register Book
Our new Branch Counselor, Deepa Miss, suggested of having an Account Register book for SB with full bank details for easy auditing.

•	IEEE Membership of volunteers
As discussed earlier that the IEEE members should get max. Participation in volunteering from March and we are failed to perform it. From ISQIP'18 it is seen that a great violation in Volunteers and it caused a great burden for the Speakers Management and Hospitality. From next Event onwards make mandatory that the Volunteers should have an IEEE membership.
This should be ensured by MDO. From next year onwards give priority to 3rd years than 4th years in Volunteering. Make Department Heads from 3rd year if they are willing.
    
•	Handling Challan of IEEE Members
From next Academic year, the IEEE Membership challan should be paid by the MDO itself, as it is found that some misbehaviour from IEEE reps of 2nd Year(2017-2021).

•	Event Treasurer
From upcoming events onwards, SB Treasurer have the right to select an Event Treasurer for that respective event. For an event, Various Department Heads should make a rough budget for their needful things and it should be placed in front of the Treasurer before 4-5 days from the event starts. Money will be given to Department Heads from SB Treasurer through Event Treasurer. It is more favourable in selecting an Event Treasurer from the ExCom itself.

•	Money Transactions
Society Chairs/members should discuss with the SB Treasurer and Branch Counselor if they need any money firstly then only with the SB Chair and SB Secretary. It is commonly seeing that members are asking money directly to Chair and Sec. 

•	Annual Year Book 2018-19
Annual Year Book should be made for the ExCom 2018-19 showing their events hosted and information regarding, so that the upcoming ExCom members can check. Workings should be done from December 2018.

•	Best IEEE Volunteer Award for SB Students
Cash Award + Trophy should be given for an IEEE member from 2nd/3rd years on the basis of their participation and coordination in various events. It can increase the sportsmanship among members and attracts other non-IEEE members in joining.
